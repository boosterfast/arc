# Data Model

Values in Arc-Lang appear 
Values in Arc-Lang are separated into semantic categories.

## Copying Semantics

All values in Arc-Lang can be sent over channels

Those which are fixed-size and 

* Fixed-size vs dynamic-size
* Interior Mutability vs 
* QoL: Debug, Clone
* Sharable vs Sendable
* Garbage collection
Values in Arc-Lang appear to the programmer as 
Every value in Arc-Runtime Arc-Runtime has two kinds of values

Now:
* Writing a lot about tasks and channels in Arc-Lang
* Writing about other parts: arc-runtime, language integrated queries
* Reading Martin Klepmann's book to find applications
  * Edge vs Cloud
    * Fault-tolerance
  * Meeting with students
