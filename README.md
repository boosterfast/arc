Programming language for data stream analysis.

## Requirements

OCaml (and dune), Rust (and cargo), and C++ (and CMake and Ninja).

## Examples

A basic streaming word-count application can be written in functional-style as follows:
```
def main() =
    source(topic: "text")
        .flatmap(fun(line: String) = line.split(" "))
        .keyby(fun(word) = word)
        .window(length = 10min, step = 3min, aggregate = count)
        .sink(topic: "wordcount")
```

The same code can also be written using a more declarative, relational-style, syntax. This concept is borrowed from [Morel](https://github.com/julianhyde/morel) and applied to streaming data.

```
def main() =
    from line: String in source(topic: "text"),
         word in line.split(" ") {
        group word
        window count as w {
            length 10min
            step 3min
            compute count
        }
        select {word, w.count}
        into sink(topic: "wordcount")
    }
```

## Feature highlights

* Statically typed with global type inference.
* Parametric polymorphism (generics and rows) and ad-hoc polymorphism (type classes).
* Mix of functional syntax, imperative control-flow/mutation, and relational operators.
* Algebraic data types.
* First-class data streams.
* Complex event processing using tasks.
* Window-based computation.
* Low-level compilation and distributed execution.
* Command-line interface for data ingestion.

Note: All features have not yet been implemented :)
